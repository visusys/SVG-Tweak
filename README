# SVG Tweak
This project is in early stages and doesn't really do anything useful yet. Ultimately it will be a cross-platform GUI tool to tweak SVG colors wihout having to open heavy vector editing software like Inkscape or Illustrator.

Caution:

I am very new to C# and this is my first application. Mistakes may be abundant.
